# Sprintets

In this diary, it is supposed to use the approach with sprints from Agile development to your projects and personal affairs aimed at self-development.

The main goals are:

1. Have an own project
2. Study a foreign language
3. Read and learn a lot.
4. Talk about your work publicly.
5. And it would be proper not always to work, but to be able to relax, travel more and spend time with family.

To implement the plan, you need motivation. And motivation wants results; otherwise, it disappears. So, I suggest that we approach our business as a personal project and goal planning as a short-distance sports race. The distance will be for two weeks. These two weeks are not scientifically proven and not confirmed, taken from personal experience.

This diary is not a magic pill from procrastination and maybe every person should have their diary suitable individually only to him.
